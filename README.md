# DjangoSiteforD3Vis

DjangoSiteforD3Vis
==================

After [discussions of what we want in projects](https://github.com/TheCodingCollective/Welcome/issues), we came up with a project that combines Django website building, databases & D3 visualization. This is the respository for building an online resource for people interested in displaying RNAseq data in a spatial matter. For example @danchitwood  made this visualization for his Calerpa data: http://danchitwood.github.io/CaulerpaGeneExpression/.
